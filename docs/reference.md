# Explorer Library

The [explorer library](../examples/lib/explorer.py) is a wrapper around some of Explorer's particulars. It aims to get you set up with a PicoGraphics surface for drawing, and help you find the right pins for the many inputs and outputs.

## Getting Started

To start coding your Pimoroni Explorer, you will need to add the following line to the start of your code file:

```python
import explorer
```

Alternatively you can import only what you plan to use in your code like so:

```python
from explorer import display, i2c, button_a
```

## Reading the Switches

Import the initialized Pin objects from the explorer library.

```python
from explorer import button_a, button_b, button_c, button_x, button_y, button_z, button_user
```
You can read the value of the a button using the Pin function `.value()` The buttons are Active Low. So you'll read `0` when the button is being pressed and `1` when it isn't!

The example below prints out the string `Pressed!` when it detects that Button A has been pressed

```python
from explorer import button_a
import time

while True:

    if button_a.value() == 0:
        print("Pressed!")
    else:
        print("Not Pressed")

    time.sleep(1)

```


## `explorer` Reference

### Index Constants

```python
SERVO_1 = 0
SERVO_2 = 1
SERVO_3 = 2
SERVO_4 = 3
```

### Count Constants

These handy constants tell you how many of something Explorer has.

```python
NUM_GPIOS = 6
NUM_ADCS = 6
NUM_SERVOS = 4
NUM_SWITCHES = 6
```

### Colour Constants

These are RGB565 colours for Explorer's default PicoGraphics instance.

```python
WHITE = 65535   # 255, 255, 255
BLACK = 0       # 0,   0,   0
CYAN = 65287    # 0,   255, 255
MAGENTA = 8184  # 255, 0,   255
YELLOW = 57599  # 255, 255, 0
GREEN = 57351   # 0,   255, 0
RED = 248       # 255, 0,   0
BLUE = 7936     # 0,   0,   255
```

If you're wondering how these baffling numbers are arrived at, we start with three 8-bit values for Red, Green and Blue:

```
red = RRRRRRRR 
green = GGGGGGGG
blue = BBBBBBBB
```

Then we chop them down to 5, 6 and 5 bits respectively:

```
red = RRRRR
green = GGGGGG
blue = BBBBB
```

And stick them together:

```
rgb565 = RRRRRGGGGGGBBBBB
```

And byteswap them (swap the lower 8 bits with the upper 8 bits, for reasons):

```
rgb565 = GGGBBBBBRRRRRGGG
```

And that's why 255 red, or `0b0000000011111000` equals 248.

### Pin Constants

Constants for all the pins you might need to access on Explorer:

```python
SWITCH_A_PIN = 16
SWITCH_B_PIN = 15
SWITCH_C_PIN = 14
SWITCH_X_PIN = 17
SWITCH_Y_PIN = 18
SWITCH_Z_PIN = 19

```

### Audio Constants

```python
AMP_CORRECTION = 4

```

### Variables

Defines a few values that you'll probably use most:

* `i2c` - A `machine.I2C` compatible I2C instance for I2C devices connected to the Qw/St socket
* `audio_pwm` - A `machine.PWM` instance to drive the piezo for beeps and boops
* `servos` - A list containing four `Servo` instances for driving the four servo connectors
* `display` - A PicoGraphics instance, configured in RGB565 pen mode with two drawing layers
* `button_<BTN>` - A collection of six `machine.Pin` instances for reading the onboard button
* `button_user` - A `machine.Pin` instance for reading the user / boot button

```python
i2c: PimoroniI2C
audio_pwm: PWM

button_a: Pin
button_b: Pin
button_c: Pin
button_x: Pin
button_y: Pin
button_z: Pin
button_user: Pin

display: PicoGraphics

play_tone(frequency: float) -> None
play_silence() -> None
stop_playing() -> None
set_volume(volume: float=None) -> None
mute_audio(value: bool=True) -> None
```

# PicoGraphics

Explorer, like all of our display products, uses our in-house framebuffer graphics library - PicoGraphics.

PicoGraphics is a wrapper around a big ol' chunk of RAM, which corresponds to the pixels on an attached display. By default, Explorer is configured in RGB565 mode which corresponds to two bytes per pixel, or 5 bits of red, 6 bits of green and 5 bits of blue respectively. It's also known as 65k colour, and does a pretty good job of making pretty pictures at half (rather than 2/3rds) the RAM cost (for awkward technical reasons) of RGB888.

## Basic Drawing Functions

Since there are many, many things you can do with PicoGraphics that would be silly to repeat here, I'll send you over to our main MicroPython repository for [a full PicoGraphics function reference][https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/blob/main/micropython/modules/picographics/README.md#function-reference]

## Changing The Display Mode

You can replace `explorer.display` by just creating a PicoGraphics instance as normal, for example switching into RGB332 mode (1 byte per pixel) to save RAM can be done by just replacing `explorer.display`:

```python
from picographics import PicoGraphics, DISPLAY_EXPLORER, PEN_RGB332
explorer.display = PicoGraphics(display=DISPLAY_EXPLORER, pen_type=PEN_RGB332, layers=2)
```

We use two layers by default, since that extra layer is handy for static backgrounds and other fun drawing tricks.

## JPEG Decoding

Sometimes it's easy just to grab a JPEG file from somewhere, squash it down and display it on your screen. You can rely on JPEGs lossy compression to help fit more images on your flash storage.

You can find documentation for the JPEG decoder in our [PicoGraphics reference](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/tree/main/micropython/modules/picographics#jpeg-files).

## PNG Decoding

More often than not you want your image to look exactly as you intended it, without ugly compression artifacts and distortion. This is particularly useful for icons and interface elements- for which you should use the PNG format and aim for a palette mode image with as few colours as you can represent your artwork in.

You can find documentation for PNG decoder in our [PicoGraphics reference](
https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/tree/main/micropython/modules/picographics#png-files).

# PicoVector

Explorer includes our new and improved PicoVector library, bringing vector graphics and text along with it.

## Setup & Anti-aliasing

The first step is to create a PicoVector instance:

```python
from picovector import PicoVector

vector = PicoVector(explorer.display)
```

You should then pick an anti-aliasing method. Anti-aliasing is the technique that turns harsh, pixellated edges into a smooth transition between elements. You probably look at it all day without realising, and on Explorer there's a very real tradeoff between speed and anti-aliasing quality. You can pick one of:

* `ANTIALIAS_NONE` - Turn off anti-aliasing altogether
* `ANTIALIAS_FAST` - A nice balance between none, and best
* `ANTIALIAS_BEST` - High quality x16 anti-aliasing

And set it with:

```python
from picovector import PicoVector, ANTIALIAS_BEST

vector = PicoVector(explorer.display)
vector.set_antialiasing(ANTIALIAS_BEST)
```

## Shapes & Primitives

PicoVector is built around polygons, which is really a collection of arbitrary paths that describe a shape. You create a shape by adding predefined primitives to you "Polygon", these are:

* `rectangle(x, y, w, h [, (corners), stroke])` - A rectangle, with a optional tuple of four corner radii or a stroke width to convert it into an outline
* `regular(x, y, radius, sides [, stroke])` - A regular polygon. Starts as a triangle and converges to a circle. Providing a stroke with makes it an outline.
* `path((x, y), (x, y), (x, y), ...)` - A closed path consisting of at least three points (two would be an invisible line!)
* `circle(x, y, radius [, stroke])` - A circle, with optional stroke to make it an outline
* `arc(x, y, radius, from, to [, stroke])` - A circular arc between the angles from and to

## Fonts & Text

* `set_font(filename)` - Load an `.af` font from flash.
* `set_font_size(size)` - What units are we using here? TODO: Maybe we need to normalise this somehow!
* `set_font_word_spacing(spacing)` - The worst named function ever! Sets the space between words.
* `set_font_letter_spacing(spacing)` - Sets the space between letters.
* `set_font_line_height(spacing)` - Sets the text line-height.
* `set_font_align(spacing)` - Sets the text alignment, for reasons currently only *horizontal* alignment works. Remind me to fix this!

## Transforms

Every time you draw something with PicoVector, it's affected by the `transform` you've set. This is how you rotate, scale and translate your shapes to position them on the screen.

* `transform = Transform()` - Create a new transform
* `transform.rotate(angle degrees, (origin_x, origin_y))`
* `transform.scale(scale_x, scale_y)`
* `transform.translate(translate_x, translate_y)`
* `transform.reset()`

To create a new transform you should create it, apply it to your vector instance and add some transformations:

```python
from picovector import PicoVector, Transform

vector = PicoVector(explorer.display)
transform = Transform()
vector.set_transform(transform)

transform.rotate(90, (0, 0))
transform.scale(10)
```

For a clean slate, you can reset your transform back to its original state:

```python
transform.reset()
```

Transformations can be a little confusing
